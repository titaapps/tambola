# Tambola Number Generator
This is the same code that powers Tambola Fun number generator at https://www.tambolafun.com/board.php

Feel free to modify it and create your own personal Tambola number generator. It's ready to use and we have put everything in a single HTML file so you just need to download a single file and open in your browser.

## IMPORTANT 
Code will not work till you replace your own API key for Responsive Voice in the code with yours. Search for **RV_KEY** in the code and replace with your own key. You can generate a free key from their website (https://responsivevoice.org/register/). 

But if you do not want voice support then remove all code related to responsive voice and you should be good.

# Dependencies
* Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) - For basic layout and design.
* Responsive Voice (https://responsivevoice.org/) - We use  for audio when numbers are called. You can change the code to use any language they support. You would also need to modify the speech in the code appropriately.
